# Project: Reproducibility of PD-ICA and ET/PD/NC comparison
The aim of this project is to test the reproducibility and replicatability of PD-ICA networks from [(Yashar, etal. 2015)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/08440) in a small local dataset and make it reproducible or replicatable if possible or investigate the reasons why it is not replicatable or replicatable. The ultimate goal of this project is to augment the inferences done with small local dataset with the avalable information from larger open dataset.

# Research questions and progress
1. Can we reproduce the PD-ICA with the original data?

   Yes, with Jacobians.
2. Can we replicate the PD-ICA with the MNI data?

   No, not yet. Possible reasons are: 1) Confounder effect; 2) Disease stages (de novo PD vs advanced PD (evaluated for surgery))
3. How can we remove the confounders from volumetry data and imaging data?

   On going.
   1. Comparing ET/NC cerebelum group differences in local dataset. 
4. Are we able to replicate the PD-ICA with confounder controled? What is the implication for this results?

   Not yet.
