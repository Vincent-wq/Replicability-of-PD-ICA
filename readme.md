# Under Construction

# Project: Reproducibility of PD-ICA and ET/PD/NC comparison
The aim of this project is to first test the reproducibility of PD-ICA networks in a small local dataset. 

# Research questions and progress
1. Can we reproduce the PD-ICA with the original data?

   Yes, with Jacobians.
2. Can we replicate the PD-ICA with the MNI data?

   No, not yet. Possible reasons are: 1) Confounder effect; 2) Disease stages (de novo PD vs advanced PD (evaluated for surgery))
3. How can we remove the confounders from volumetry data and imaging data?

   On going.
   1. Comparing ET/NC cerebelum group differences in local dataset. 
4. Are we able to replicate the PD-ICA with confounder controled? What is the implication for this results?

   Not yet.
